# US-002: Guild Details Page

As a user, I want to view details about a MapleStory SEA guild, so that I can see guild information, emblem, member list, and stats in a visually appealing layout.

- Create a dedicated guild details page.
- Fetch guild info using the Nexon API (e.g., /guild/basic, /guild/member).
- Display guild name, emblem, member list, and stats in a styled card or table.
- Use similar layout and design as the character details page for consistency.
