# US-001: Character Details Page

As a user, I want to view detailed information about a MapleStory SEA character, so that I can see their stats, hyper stats, abilities, and equipped items in a well-designed, readable format.

- Integrate all relevant MapleStory SEA APIs: basic, stat, hyper-stat, ability, item-equipment.
- Display each section with clear headings and formatted data (tables, cards, or collapsible JSON for advanced details).
- Use Tailwind CSS for spacing, color, and responsive layout.
- Add a scrollable container for the details card.
- Example sections: Character Info, Stats, Hyper Stats, Abilities, Item Equipment.
